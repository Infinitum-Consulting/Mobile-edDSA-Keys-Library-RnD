1. Android Keystore system 

Key chain API 
Android Keystore provider

Use the KeyChain API when you want system-wide credentials. When an app requests the use of any credential through the KeyChain API, users can choose, through a system-provided UI, which of the installed credentials an app can access. This lets several apps use the same set of credentials with user consent.

Use the Android Keystore provider to let an individual app store its own credentials, which only that app can access. This provides a way for apps to manage credentials that only they can use while providing the same security benefits that the KeyChain API provides for system-wide credentials. This method doesn't require the user to select the credentials.
