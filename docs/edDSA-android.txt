1. Android Keystore system 

Key chain API 
Android Keystore provider

Use the KeyChain API when you want system-wide credentials. When an app requests the use of any credential through the KeyChain API, users can choose, through a system-provided UI, which of the installed credentials an app can access. This lets several apps use the same set of credentials with user consent.

Use the Android Keystore provider to let an individual app store its own credentials, which only that app can access. This provides a way for apps to manage credentials that only they can use while providing the same security benefits that the KeyChain API provides for system-wide credentials. This method doesn't require the user to select the credentials.

SecuredKeychainProvider
 A React context provider that manages secure retrieval of sensitive cryptographic information:

## Main Responsibilities:
- Provides methods to retrieve mnemonics and seeds
- Implements a security workflow for accessing sensitive data
- Handles different authentication scenarios

## Key Methods

-- getSecuredValue()
Central method for retrieving sensitive information
Handles different authentication scenarios
Manages the retrieval process dynamically

-- checkPassword()
Validates user-entered password
Retrieves secret if password is correct
Manages lockout and error states
Secure Retrieval Methods

-- getMnemonic()
Retrieves wallet recovery phrase
Optional error handling
Requires authentication if seed is protected

-- getSeed()
Retrieves cryptographic seed
Converts hex string to ArrayBuffer
Requires a rationale for access
Supports optional error throwing

Keystore provides the following categories of operations:

Key generation
Import and export of asymmetric keys (no key wrapping)
Import of raw symmetric keys (no key wrapping)
Asymmetric encryption and decryption with appropriate padding modes
Asymmetric signing and verification with digesting and appropriate padding modes
Symmetric encryption and decryption in appropriate modes, including an AEAD mode
Generation and verification of symmetric message authentication codes

## Another Method of storing the keys 
 
Hardware-Backed Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

What it is: Use a Secure Element (SE) or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to store keys securely at the hardware level.

Why it's secure:
The keys never leave the hardware and are isolated from the OS.
Access to keys is only allowed for cryptographic operations.
Example: Use StrongBox with the Keystore to leverage hardware-backed key storage
