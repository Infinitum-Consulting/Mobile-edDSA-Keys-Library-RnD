Problems:
- Research secure key generation and storage on mobile hardware.
- Develop a prototype for cloud backup encryption and storage.
- Key Rotation and passkeys

Modules:
- Secure Key Generation
- Secure Enclave Research with React Native
- Cloud Backup Research (examples: Metamask, Rainbow)
- Other Modes of Backup, and key storage
- Key Rotation
- Passkeys
- Reading about compliance (FIPS 140-2/3)

IOS:
- Two ways to store the keys: - using the keychain, and using the secure enclave, the con of using secure enclare is the key will only be available on that particular device and will not be exportable

Android:
- Two ways to store these keys: using Android Keystore System, and using the TEE, or Secure Elements.

Important Thing to keep in mind, while in production:
- Disable logging
- Using constant time algorithms
- Monitoring and Limiting the rate of cryptographic operations to prevent analysis.
- Reduce Attack Surface, by limiting the number of functions that have access of the key
- Implement access control and use authentication for key access (biometrics, and passcodes) 


Notes:
- The Library used for generating the edDSA should ideally use CSPRNGs for randomness.
- Should use trusted libraries, like, IOS has CryptoKit 

Recommendations:
- Maci:
    - Add Invalided Keys Module in MACI for supporting Key Rotation.
